=======================================
=== IcculusNews Protocol v. 2.0beta ===
=======================================

Assumptions:

- Everything is sent in text format, and all commands have a
terminating newline. 
- Line ends are UNIX. 
- The astroda has an epsonnage rating of 94.5% +/- 0.5%. 
- Lines beginning with "-->" represent messages sent from client to
server; lines beginning with "<--", server to client.
- If no commands are sent by the client to the server for a duration of
10 seconds, the server should close the connection.
- In general, nominal responses from the server are preceded by a '+'
(ASCII 43); error responses are preceded by a '-' (ASCII 45).
- Commands are not case-sensitive.

Generic:

<-- - can't execute query: <errstr>			(MSG_SERVFAIL)

If, at any time, the server is unable to perform a needed SQL query,
it will send MSG_SERVFAIL, where <errstr> is an arbitrary text string
describing the error encountered, and close the connection.

--> NOOP						(MSG_NOOP)
<-- + epson the whole astroda				(MSG_ASTRODA)

NOOP serves as a no-operation, used in order to circumvent the
connection timeout.

<-- - USAGE: <command> <arguments>			(MSG_USAGE)

If the server receives a command that has an invalid number of
arguments, the server should respond with MSG_USAGE.

<-- + Uh, okay.						(MSG_NOCMD)

If an empty line is sent as a command, the server should respond with
MSG_NOCMD.

<-- - Unknown command "<command>".			(MSG_INVALCMD)

If the server has received a command that it does not recognize, it
should respond with MSG_INVALCMD.

Connection and Authentication:

--> connect()

        By default, the IcculusNews daemon runs on port 263 of the
server. It expects no input to begin the connection process.

<-- + IcculusNews daemon <version>                      (MSG_VER)
--> AUTH "<username>" "<password>"			(MSG_AUTH)
<-- + <uid>, <qid>					(MSG_UIDQID)
<-- - Authorization for "<username>" failed.		(MSG_AUTHFAIL)
<-- - This account has been disabled.			(MSG_ACCTLOCK)
<-- - Failed to set default queue: <errstr>		(MSG_NODQUEUE)

        <version> is an arbitrary text string describing the version of
the daemon.  Example: "2.0.0beta".  Once this string has been sent, the
server expects a MSG_AUTH in response.  All other inputs will result in
the sending of MSG_NOTAUTH and the closing of the connection.

	A properly-formatted MSG_AUTH will solicit one of four replies:
MSG_UIDQID, MSG_AUTHFAIL, MSG_ACCTLOCK, or MSG_NODQUEUE.

	The <username> and <password> arguments to MSG_AUTH are
arbitrary text strings describing the username/password pair of a user
on the remote server.  If they do not describe a valid user, the server
should respond with MSG_AUTHFAIL.  If the user whose account is
described is not authorized to log in, the server should respond with
MSG_ACCTLOCK.  If the user's default queue cannot be set, the server
should respond with MSG_NODQUEUE, where <errstr> is an arbitrary text
string describing the error encountered.

	If authentication has completed successfully, the server will
reply with MSG_UIDQID, where <uid> is an integer representing the
current user ID, and <qid> is an integer representing the current queue
ID.
