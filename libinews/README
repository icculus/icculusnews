Until I get around to autoconfiscating this thing, read the following few
notes:

- sscanf() is broken on the current glibc trunk.  If you're using Gentoo,
	or any other distro (except Debian, which seems to have fixed it in the
	2.2.5 series), and you get mysterious segfaults in INEWS_submitArticle(),
	rebuild libinews with the define I_LIKE_BROKEN_SSCANF_AND_I_CANNOT_LIE.
	If you're too lazy to figure this out yourself, run make like so:

	make all CFLAGS="-DI_LIKE_BROKEN_SSCANF_AND_I_CANNOT_LIE".

- This library's probably kinda sorta thread-safe, but I don't make any
	guarantees.

- pth (GNU Portable Threads), the replacement for the venerable pthreads,
	can be found at:

	http://www.gnu.org/software/pth.
